# AIOrganoids
 
A Matlab code to simulate the morphogenesis of organoids with a hybrid physics-based and data driven model. 

Physics-based model: agent-based lattice-free center-based model

Data-driven model: neural network

# Description: 

Open the file "Main.m", change the target times and number of cells, and run the code. The result will be saved in the 
"Results" folder. 

"aiOrganoids.m" is the computational model. It also includes postprocessing options. 

The "nnFunctions" folder contains the functions of the neural network.

The "Data" folder contains the weights of the trained neural network.
